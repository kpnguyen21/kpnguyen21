<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>MarketMind: Unveiling Stock Trends with Machine Learning - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2024</h3>
<li>I focused on classifying trading decisions for Ford‚Äôs stock. Among 26 companies with direct and indirect connections to Ford, I identified 6 companies that were highly correlated with and Granger-caused Ford's stock movements. I gathered 5 years of data from Yahoo Finance and trained various models using 3 years of data (up to October 2024), reserving the first 2 years for backtesting. I validated the models by trading Ford‚Äôs stock on the Investopedia Simulation platform. While regression and XGBoost models performed well on the backtesting sets, the regression model and SVM excelled in predicting trading decisions for Ford in November 2024. <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/fall-2024/data-science-boot-camp/khanh-nguyen">[LINK]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kpnguyen21/equity-vs-commodity">[GIT]</a>, <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/_files/ugd/eda2b9_5fd77770327b46a48407f0648b8b59b6.pdf">[SLIDES]</a>

<h3>Imputing missing data from stock time series - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2024</h3>
<li>My objective was to address missing data in stock time series. We obtained Apple‚Äôs 2023 data from Yahoo Finance and randomly removed data points. We experimented with various imputation methods, including, but not limited to, linear interpolation, KNN, linear regression, and VAR. Using Python, we determined that linear interpolation proved to be a robust choice for filling both small and large gaps in this specific time series. <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/may-summer-2024/data-science-boot-camp/khanh-nguyen">[LINK]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bootstrapM/erdos-may-2024-imputing-data/">[GIT]</a>, <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/_files/ugd/eda2b9_479d0ca1ce454cf3950447646f2e832a.pdf">[SLIDES]</a>

<h3>Modeling the continuous-perceptual-report task - German Primate Center (DPZ) - 2020-2022</h3>
<li>DPZ was one of the first groups in the world to design experiments to study continuous decision-making processes, and new model approaches were needed. An example of continuous decision-making processes was drivers continuously paid attention to their obstacles and other drivers to steer the wheels accordingly. I developed a two-dimensional leaky integrator as an ideal subject in a solo continuous task. In a social setting, I implemented the Auto-regressive Moving Average model and computed Granger Causality to determine the information flow between two subjects. My numerical simulations predicted real humans' behaviors well for easy and intermediate tasks. My model also captured delay in reaction time and information-lost rate for each human subject.

<h3>Engineering Humans‚Äô choices - NeuroBridges Summer Program	- 2019</h3>
<li>I was interested in quantitative model to shape people's choices. I designed a binary task with 25% reward was given in such a way that oblivious human subjects picked our preferred choices. I acquired data from other attendees and did the analysis using Python. My reward schedule was able to engineer subjects' choices. We found that the first reward choice may shape subject's beliefs on "correct" choice.
</li>

<h3>Intertrial correlations in sequential decision-making tasks - University of Houston	- 2017-2020</h3>
<li>I was interested in strategies that humans and animals used to adjust their behaviors in a changing world with uncertain feedback. I considered a stochastic model of an ideal observer presented with a sequence of decision-making trials, in which the correct choice switches between trials. On subsequent trials, I quantified the observer's bias based on the previous decision, and on how likely the true choice is switches between trials. When no feedback was present, the best strategy was to spend more time on the first trial, so the observer profited from the bias collected on later trials. When feedback was provided as probabilistic signals, the observer should spend time to consider options and increased certainty as rewards were based on correct choices. When feedback was in form of probabilistic reward, the best strategy was to make immediate decisions to save time for more trials as accuracy was less important. <a href="https://github.com/kpnguyen21/sequential">[GIT]</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2018.11.001">[PAPER]</a>

<h3>Human Guided Machine Vision for Road Detection - Institute for Mathematics and its Applications	- 2016 
</h3>
<li>The goal for this project was to create an interface using MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox that allowed users to detect roads from satellite images. From a variety of satellite images from Google Earth, I first converted the images into pixel intensity value, then detected edges and filtered the images, and finally segmented the images based on connectivity. The algorithm worked well for simple highway connections and isolated roads. For more difficult images, such as roads with heavy traffic, using a local filtering and tracking system could improve the results. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BujspAgZGKxV-pdFAXQV9h8zl0Cibx9s/view?usp=sharing">[SLIDES]</a>

<h3>The Bathtub of the Future: Backed by Science - Institute for Mathematics and its Applications - 2016</h3>         
<li>I was assigned to design a bathtub that conserved water and energy. I considered three features of a bathtub: dimensions/ shapes, thickness of wall, and location of jets. I applied standard fluid flow and heat transfer equations using COMSOL Multiphysics. I found that a deeper bathtub with a constant flow rate while the drain and faucet were far apart would satisfy the conservative conditions.</li>

<h3>Sensory feedback in a bump attractor model of path integration - University of Houston - 2013-2015 
</h3>
<li>I wanted to explore the influence connection architecture on the robustness of persistent activity in neuronal networks responsible for spatial navigation. The hypothesis was that input from the visual system served as feedback control to that sensory stimuli can improve the robustness of positional memory. I analyzed PDE model of the neural activity that represents an animal's position in physical space and implemented numerical simulations that demonstrated how noise impacts the network's memory of the spatial position. My analysis and simulations showed that our hypothesis was correct. <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-015-0588-y">[PAPER]</a>

<h3>Monte Carlo Simulations of Crystallization in Pentomino Fluids - University of Texas at Dallas - 2013     
</h3>
<li>My goal was to understand the self-assembly of molecules adsorbed on surface, which was an important process in nanotechnology. Earlier work suggested that the fluid we were studying underwent a phase transition to a crystalline state at a chemical potential near 4.0. My project was to investigate the appearance and growth of crystals during this phase transition using a simple lattice model and Monte Carlo simulations. I found that the average and maximum sizes of the crystals increased, while the number of crystals decreased over time. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2hSQn9VZh9Os-JxeiTPyDuocDGokBBk/view">[POSTER]</a>
