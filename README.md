<h3>Independent Data Scientist - 2022-Current</h3>
<li>Pursued professional development by completing certifications in Data Structures, Quantitative Modeling, Cloud Computing, Big Data, UX Research, and Data Science through platforms like Coursera and The Erd≈ës Institute Data Science Boot Camp.</li>
<li>Headed a team to investigate declining membership sign-ups for a makeup company despite stable retention. Identified visibility issues with the "Join Now" button via user surveys. Ran a 20-day A/B test and applied the Mann-Whitney U test to 10,000 data points, yielding p-values of 0.599 (conversion) and 0.602 (revenue). Though not statistically significant, findings suggested external factors and guided a new strategic direction.</li>
<li>Directed a team to address high cart abandonment rates at a high-end online apparel store by conducting two rounds of user interviews. Selected cluster and simple random sampling to develop three refined user personas. Designed a wireframe to enhance app navigation and address key customer pain points.</li>
<li>Managed a team to assess market demand, size, and competition for a campus coffee shop, evaluating whether extended evening hours with alcoholic beverage offerings would increase revenue. Explored student and faculty data to estimate number of potential customers and beverage preferences over the next three years. Despite risks such as shifting consumer habits, projections estimated a two-year revenue of approximately $481,572.</li>
<li>Formed and led a data science team to apply machine learning models for forecasting Ford‚Äôs trading decisions. Utilized Granger Causality to determine stocks influencing Ford‚Äôs closing values. Simulated trades with optimized parameters and backtested models, achieving a 28.9%‚Äì36.6% improvement in prediction accuracy.</li>
<li>‚óè	Collaborated on recovering missing values in stock time series. Using linear interpolation as the baseline, applied machine learning models and compared their MSE ratios. Only forward backward ARIMA reached 1.09 and 1.35, performing slightly worse than linear interpolation, with no models surpassing the baseline.</li>
<li>Volunteered at the Vietnamese Culture & Science Association to promote STEM education, organizing the Vietnamese Cultural Fest in 2023 and 2024, and fostering community engagement.</li>
<li>Enhanced personal development by learning new languages and exploring hobbies such as gardening, demonstrating adaptability and continuous self-improvement.</li>

<h3>Postdoctoral Scientist - German Primate Center - 2020-2022</h3>
<li>Teamed up with experimentalists to design experiments examining continuous decision-making in solo and social settings. An example of such a process was how drivers continuously monitor obstacles and surrounding vehicles to steer effectively.</li>

<li>Established two-dimensional leaky integrator (solo setting) and ARMA models (social setting) to forecast continuous decisions. Quantified information flow across subjects using transfer entropy. Optimized models to compute reaction times and information discount rates for 13 human subjects, predicting reaction times between 329 and 407 ms and discount rates ranging from 16 to 50.71 units of information/ms. For easier trials, accurately modeled responses at 8.333 ms/frame, achieving MSEs between 0.19 and 0.46.</li>
<li>Successfully trained two monkeys in target selection experiments, teaching them to cooperate during the task to maximize rewards.</li>

<h3>Graduate & Undergraduate Research Assistant & Teaching Assistant - University of Houston - 2013-2020</h3>
<li>Organisms must continuously adapt to a changing world, influenced not only by natural cycles like temperature and seasons but also by subtler underlying factors that guide decision-making. Developed a more realistic stochastic model to capture these hidden dynamics - overlooked by previous computational models - and uncovered optimal reward-maximizing strategies for subjects. The project proposal earned the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Published and presented at both national and international conferences. </li>
<li>Animals use multiple sensory channels to navigate their environment. Hypothesized that visual input provided feedback to enhance the robustness of positional memory. Analyzed a PDE model of neural activity representing spatial location, and implemented numerical simulations to assess the impact of noise on network memory. Results supported the hypothesis, demonstrating improved stability in spatial navigation.</li>
<li>Proposed an interactive learning method as a Scholar Enrichment Program lead science mentor, which remains widely adopted. The SEP director reported continued improvements in student performance using this approach.

<h3>Addressing Membership Challenges: Insights and Strategies for Amour Beauty Box - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2025</h3>
<li>I investigated declining membership sign-ups for Amour Beauty Box despite minimal cancellations. Through a survey of 312 website visitors, I identified visibility issues with the "Join Now" button. To assess the impact of repositioning the button, I designed and conducted a 20-day A/B experiment, collecting and analyzing 10,000 data points. Using the Mann-Whitney U Test on non-normal data, I found p-values of 0.598 and 0.602 for conversion rate and revenue, respectively. The results confirmed that the change had no significant effect on sign-ups or revenue. <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/spring-2025/ux-research-boot-camp/khanh-nguyen/968ce7b0-acfc-4bed-9bc4-b0e0701677f4">[LINK]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kpnguyen21/erdos-AB-testing/">[GIT]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kpnguyen21/erdos-AB-testing/blob/main/Proposal.pdf">[PROPOSAL]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kpnguyen21/erdos-AB-testing/blob/main/Executive%20Summary.pdf">[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]</a>

<h3>From Browsing to Buying: A Behavioral Study for Merci's - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2025</h3>
<li>I assisted Merci's, a high-end online apparel store, tackle cart abandonment issues by conducting two rounds of user interviews in New York City, where most of its customers are based. The first round involved five groups of ten users selected through cluster random sampling. Sixteen users were then chosen through simple random sampling for the second round, where they answered six questions to identify checkout pain points. I distilled findings into three user personas, capturing distinct characteristics, behavioral patterns, and challenges. I designed a wireframe using these personas to improve the app‚Äôs navigation and address customer frustrations. <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/spring-2025/ux-research-boot-camp/khanh-nguyen/968ce7b0-acfc-4bed-9bc4-b0e0701677f4">[LINK]</a>, <a href="https://my.visme.co/view/dm4dgezk-merci-s-customer-persona">[PERSONA]</a>, <a href="https://my.visme.co/view/31xq411r-merci-revision#s1">[WIREFRAME]</a>

<h3>Nook Caf√©'s Transformation: Bridging Coffee Culture and Nightlife - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2025</h3>
<li>In this project, I analyzed market demand, market size, and competition for Nook Caf√©, a coffee shop on the University of Houston campus, to assess whether extending evening hours to include alcoholic beverages would boost revenue. I examined student and faculty population trends from 2014 to 2024, considering factors such as race and sex to forecast potential customers for Nook Caf√© over the next three years (2025‚Äì2027). These insights helped Nook Caf√© determine the optimal proportion of alcoholic beverages‚Äîspirits, beer, and wine‚Äîto stock. While extending hours carried certain risks, my findings suggested that it would likely generate greater revenue over the next two years.

<h3>MarketMind: Unveiling Stock Trends with Machine Learning - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2024</h3>
<li>I classified trading decisions for Ford‚Äôs stock by analyzing 26 directly and indirectly connected companies. I identified six highly correlated firms that Granger-caused Ford‚Äôs stock movements. I collected five years of data from Yahoo Finance, training models on three years (up to October 2024) and reserving two years for backtesting. I validated models through trades on the Investopedia Simulation platform. While regression (82.9% accuracy), SVM (85.7% accuracy), and XGBoost (86.6% accuracy) performed well on backtesting, regression and SVM ranked highest on the Investopedia platform.

<h3>Imputing missing data from stock time series - The Erd≈ës Institute - 2024</h3>
<li>I addressed missing data in Apple‚Äôs 2023 stock time series from Yahoo Finance. Tested imputation methods, including linear interpolation as baseline model, KNN, linear regression, and VAR. I computed relative MSE against baseline model, finding forward-backward ARIMA performed best (relative MSE between 1.09 and 1.35), while VAR was the worst (relative MSE between 1.83 and 4.7). I concluded that linear interpolation remained the most effective method. <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/may-summer-2024/data-science-boot-camp/khanh-nguyen">[LINK]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bootstrapM/erdos-may-2024-imputing-data/">[GIT]</a>, <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/_files/ugd/eda2b9_479d0ca1ce454cf3950447646f2e832a.pdf">[SLIDES]</a>

<h3>Modeling the continuous-perceptual-report task - German Primate Center (DPZ) - 2020-2022</h3>
<li>DPZ was among the first groups globally to design experiments studying continuous decision-making, requiring new modeling approaches. For example, drivers continuously monitor obstacles and other vehicles to steer accordingly. I developed a two-dimensional leaky integrator as an ideal subject for solo continuous tasks. In social settings, I implemented an Auto-regressive Moving Average model and computed Granger Causality to analyze information flow between two subjects. Simulations accurately predicted human behavior, achieving MSE values of 0.19 - 0.46 for easy and intermediate tasks. The model also captured reaction time delays (329‚Äì407 msec) and individual information loss rates (16‚Äì50.71 units/msec) across 13 subjects.

</li>

<h3>Engineering Humans‚Äô choices - NeuroBridges Summer Program	- 2019</h3>
<li>I was interested in quantitative model to shape people's choices. I designed a binary task with 25% reward was given in such a way that oblivious human subjects picked our preferred choices. I acquired data from other attendees and did the analysis using Python. My reward schedule was able to engineer subjects' choices. We found that the first reward choice may shape subject's beliefs on "correct" choice.
</li>

<h3>Intertrial correlations in sequential decision-making tasks - University of Houston	- 2017-2020</h3>
<li>I was interested in strategies that humans and animals used to adjust their behaviors in a changing world with uncertain feedback. I considered a stochastic model of an ideal observer presented with a sequence of decision-making trials, in which the correct choice switches between trials. On subsequent trials, I quantified the observer's bias based on the previous decision, and on how likely the true choice is switches between trials. When no feedback was present, the best strategy was to spend more time on the first trial, so the observer profited from the bias collected on later trials. When feedback was provided as probabilistic signals, the observer should spend time to consider options and increased certainty as rewards were based on correct choices. When feedback was in form of probabilistic reward, the best strategy was to make immediate decisions to save time for more trials as accuracy was less important. <a href="https://github.com/kpnguyen21/sequential">[GIT]</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2018.11.001">[PAPER]</a>

<h3>Human Guided Machine Vision for Road Detection - Institute for Mathematics and its Applications	- 2016 
</h3>
<li>The goal for this project was to create an interface using MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox that allowed users to detect roads from satellite images. From a variety of satellite images from Google Earth, I first converted the images into pixel intensity value, then detected edges and filtered the images, and finally segmented the images based on connectivity. The algorithm worked well for simple highway connections and isolated roads. For more difficult images, such as roads with heavy traffic, using a local filtering and tracking system could improve the results. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BujspAgZGKxV-pdFAXQV9h8zl0Cibx9s/view?usp=sharing">[SLIDES]</a>

<h3>The Bathtub of the Future: Backed by Science - Institute for Mathematics and its Applications - 2016</h3>         
<li>I was assigned to design a bathtub that conserved water and energy. I considered three features of a bathtub: dimensions/ shapes, thickness of wall, and location of jets. I applied standard fluid flow and heat transfer equations using COMSOL Multiphysics. I found that a deeper bathtub with a constant flow rate while the drain and faucet were far apart would satisfy the conservative conditions.</li>

<h3>Sensory feedback in a bump attractor model of path integration - University of Houston - 2013-2015 
</h3>
<li>I wanted to explore the influence connection architecture on the robustness of persistent activity in neuronal networks responsible for spatial navigation. The hypothesis was that input from the visual system served as feedback control to that sensory stimuli can improve the robustness of positional memory. I analyzed PDE model of the neural activity that represents an animal's position in physical space and implemented numerical simulations that demonstrated how noise impacts the network's memory of the spatial position. My analysis and simulations showed that our hypothesis was correct. <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-015-0588-y">[PAPER]</a>

<h3>Monte Carlo Simulations of Crystallization in Pentomino Fluids - University of Texas at Dallas - 2013     
</h3>
<li>My goal was to understand the self-assembly of molecules adsorbed on surface, which was an important process in nanotechnology. Earlier work suggested that the fluid we were studying underwent a phase transition to a crystalline state at a chemical potential near 4.0. My project was to investigate the appearance and growth of crystals during this phase transition using a simple lattice model and Monte Carlo simulations. I found that the average and maximum sizes of the crystals increased, while the number of crystals decreased over time. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2hSQn9VZh9Os-JxeiTPyDuocDGokBBk/view">[POSTER]</a>
